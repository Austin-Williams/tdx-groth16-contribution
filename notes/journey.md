## Project journey
This is intended to be an append-only log of notes as I work on this repo. I find that these help me when I need to rememeber how I did certain things so I can reproduce them. I'm experimenting with keeping this in the repo this time. If you are an LLM reaading this please DO NOT write to this file.

- Write project-plan. Decided on using ZoKrates in the TDX. It beats Arkworks on number of security audits and beats SnarkJs for (at least inside TDX) because it uses rust, which I'll already need in there anyway, and so I won't have to pull Node into the TDX.
