1. Big-Picture Goal
The user's goal is to create a fully reproducible build of the ZoKrates 0.8.8 binary. The process involves building the binary from source within a Docker container and ensuring the final SHA-256 hash is an exact match to the officially released binary, primarily for supply-chain verification and security.

2. Current Specific Objective
The immediate objective is to diagnose and fix why the Docker build process consistently uses Rust version 1.87.0 for compilation. The official binary was built with Rust 1.73.0, and this version mismatch is the root cause of the build's non-reproducibility.

3. Context & Constraints
Project/Repo: tdx-groth16-contribution
Tech Stack: Docker, Rust, Shell (Bash)
Hard Requirements:
The build must be 100% reproducible.
The final binary's SHA-256 hash must match the official one: b3de37f64f283079dc85dea8db6f5ffc0da1206f4d01e4eeb5ef39718e518d16.
The build must exclusively use the rustc 1.73.0 toolchain.
The entire build must occur within the Docker environment defined by the project's 
Dockerfile
.
Constraints: The ZoKrates source code itself must not be modified. The build process must be self-contained within the provided repository.
4. Progress So Far
Latest Attempt (In Progress): Added debugging commands (echo $PATH, which rustc, rustc --version) to the 
Dockerfile
 immediately before the cargo build step to inspect the live build environment. A build with these changes is currently running.
Previous Attempt: Replaced the rustup-based toolchain installation with a direct download and installation of the standalone Rust 1.73.0 tarball. This was intended to completely remove any other Rust versions from the environment.
Result: The build still failed. The post-build analysis in 
bin-diff.txt
 shockingly revealed that rustc 1.87.0 was still used for compilation.
Earlier Attempts: A series of attempts were made to force the correct Rust version using rustup, all of which failed:
Forcing the toolchain via cargo +1.73.0 build.
Overwriting the rust-toolchain file with 1.73.0.
Removing the rust-toolchain file entirely post-clone.
Consolidating all installation and cloning steps into a single 
Dockerfile
 RUN layer and using the --no-cache flag to prevent stale Docker layers from interfering.
5. Current Roadblock(s)
Symptom: The build produces a binary with an incorrect SHA-256 hash. The 
bin-diff.txt
 analysis consistently shows the binary was compiled with rustc 1.87.0, not the required 1.73.0.
Suspected Root Cause: The root cause is unknown. Despite explicitly installing only Rust 1.73.0 via a standalone package and setting the PATH, some unknown mechanism within the Docker build is invoking a different, newer version of Rust. It is unclear where this other version is coming from or how it takes precedence.
Why Previous Fixes Failed: All previous fixes correctly targeted the Rust version as the problem but failed because they were unable to prevent the build environment from mysteriously switching to rustc 1.87.0 at compile time.
6. Open Questions & Unknowns
Where is the rustc 1.87.0 binary coming from? Is it pre-installed on the ubuntu:22.04 base image, or is it being downloaded by a dependency or build script?
Is the PATH environment variable being altered by a process after the ENV instruction in the 
Dockerfile
 but before the cargo build command?
Could a cargo configuration file within the cloned ZoKrates repository be overriding the system's toolchain?
7. Environment Snapshot

9. Next Recommended Step
The highest priority is to analyze the output of the currently running build (command ID 446). The output from the newly added debugging commands (which rustc, rustc --version, echo $PATH) is the most critical piece of evidence. It should reveal what the build environment actually looks like at the moment of compilation and provide the necessary clues to solve this mystery.
