## 1. Big-Picture Goal

The user wants to prove that the official pre-built ZoKrates v0.8.8 binaries released on GitHub
were in fact produced from the public source code.
They will do this by building ZoKrates from source in Docker and showing the SHA-256 hash of the
resulting zokrates binary matches the hash of the official release.

## 2. Current Specific Objective

Generate a detailed diff report (bin-diff.txt) comparing the official x86_64 Linux binary with the one produced by the current Dockerfile, to discover exactly why their SHA-256 digests differ.

## 3. Context & Constraints

• Repo: tdx-groth16-contribution; primary files are Dockerfile, scripts/build.sh, scripts/o3.sh.
• Tech: Docker, Ubuntu 20.04 base image, Rust toolchain, UPX (optional), shell scripts.
• Hard requirement: end state must truthfully reproduce the official binary hash; no fallback
hashes or “lies”.
• Host is macOS with Docker Desktop; assistant cannot access Docker daemon directly (sandboxed).
• All investigation happens via scripts/o3.sh, which the user runs and then we inspect
o3.log/bin-diff.txt.

## 4. Progress So Far

(Newest → Oldest)

    1. Added Step-3 in `scripts/o3.sh` to create `bin-diff.txt` containing build-id, rustc string,
 section headers, and section-table diff of official vs built binaries. (User has just re-run
script but file missing.)
    2. Dockerfile now:
       • Builds for `--platform=linux/amd64`.
       • Uses **regular** Ubuntu focal repos (snapshot mirror removed).
       • Installs all build deps + `upx-ucl` in one RUN.
       • Rust installed via rustup 1.73.0.
       • Builds with `cargo build --release --locked`.
       • No longer strips or UPX-compresses; RUSTFLAGS unset (keeps build-id & DWARF).
    3. Latest successful build produced SHA `904d7c…e285f` (still different from official
`b3de37…e518d16`).
       Build completed without errors; elapsed ~12 minutes compile time in Docker.
    4. Earlier mismatches caused by:
       • Wrong architecture (arm64) → apt dependency failures – fixed by `--platform`.
       • Snapshot mirror URL wrong/unavailable – eventually abandoned.
       • Stripping/UPX and suppressed build-id – removed.
    5. Helper script (`scripts/o3.sh`) logs everything to `o3.log`, copies built binary out of
image, and prints common metadata.

## 5. Current Roadblock(s)

• bin-diff.txt missing after last run – Step-3 likely skipped because one binary path variable
(BIN_TMP or TMPDIR) out of scope in the new block or because readelf not found.
• Still digest mismatch (904d7c… vs official b3de37…) — need to identify concrete byte-level
differences (timestamps? different rustc/LLVM? binutils?).
  Previous attempts removed obvious divergences (UPX, strip), but mismatch persists.

## 6. Open Questions & Unknowns

• Did Step-3 fail due to variable scope (BIN_TMP/TMPDIR defined after cd) or missing readelf?
• What rustc version was used for the official 0.8.8 artefact?
• Does the binary embed compile-time timestamps or absolute paths that differ?
• Is binutils/ld version affecting section ordering or relocs?
• Are we building the exact same dependency graph (Cargo.lock identical)?

## 7. Environment Snapshot

• Host: macOS (Apple Silicon).
• Docker Desktop available; container builds run via user.
• Dockerfile base: ubuntu:20.04 (amd64 rootfs).
• Rust toolchain installed inside container: 1.73.0 stable via rustup.
• Key paths inside container: source at /src, output at /src/target/release/zokrates.

## 8. Resources

• scripts/o3.sh – orchestrates download, build, diff.
• o3.log – streaming log from latest run (multiple runs appended).
• bin-diff.txt – intended diff report (currently missing).
• Official artefact URL: https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates/releases/download/0.8.8/zokrates-0.8
.8-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
• Commit being built: 157a824426e213fbcd05c74220c706095be1ee7a.

## 9. Next Recommended Step

Fix scripts/o3.sh diff block: ensure paths (TMPDIR, BIN_TMP) are still valid when diff runs (need
to popd back to ROOT_DIR or use absolute vars) and check that readelf exists in host OS (macOS may
 need brew install binutils or use greadelf).
Re-run script to obtain bin-diff.txt; inspect build-id, rustc version, DWARF compile unit
timestamps to isolate remaining difference.
