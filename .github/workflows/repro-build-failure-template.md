### :x: Reproducible build hash mismatch

The scheduled or triggered reproducibility check has failed.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Commit** | `${{ github.sha }}` |
| **Workflow Run** | [link](`${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`) |
| **Branch / Ref** | `${{ github.ref }}` |
| **Triggered by** | `${{ github.actor }}` |

**What happened?**

The SHA-256 checksum produced by a fresh deterministic build in CI does **not** match
`bin/zokrates-0.8.8.sha256` committed in the repository. This usually means that
one of the following changed since the last known-good build:

1. Upstream dependencies (Rust crates, base image, Debian snapshots)
2. Build scripts or Dockerfile
3. Environment variables affecting compilation

**Next steps**
1. Inspect the failed [workflow run logs](`${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`) â€“ the "Expected" vs "Actual" hashes are printed.
2. Attempt to reproduce the failure locally with `./scripts/build-zok-binary.sh OUTPUT_DIR=_local_out` and compare hashes.
3. Identify the root cause and update the committed binary & checksum **only if the change is legitimate**. Otherwise, fix the build pipeline.
