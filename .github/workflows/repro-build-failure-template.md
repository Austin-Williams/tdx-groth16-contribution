### :x: Reproducible build hash mismatch

The scheduled or triggered reproducibility check has failed.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Commit** | `${{ github.sha }}` |
| **Workflow Run** | [${{ github.run_id }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) |
| **Branch / Ref** | `${{ github.ref }}` |
| **Triggered by** | `${{ github.actor }}` |

**What happened?**

The SHA-256 checksum produced by a fresh deterministic build in CI does **not** match
`zokrates-0.8.8.sha256` committed in the repository. This usually means that
one of the following changed since the last known-good build:

1. Upstream dependencies (Rust crates, base image, Debian snapshots)
2. Build scripts or Dockerfile
3. Environment variables affecting compilation

**Next steps**
1. Inspect the failed [workflow run logs](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) â€“ the "Expected" vs "Actual" hashes are printed.
2. Download the [build artifacts](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) including `diff.txt` for detailed binary comparison.
3. Attempt to reproduce the failure locally with `BIN_OUTPUT_DIR=_local_bin HASH_OUTPUT_DIR=_local_hash ./scripts/build-zok-binary.sh` and compare hashes.
4. Identify the root cause and update the committed binary & checksum **only if the change is legitimate**. Otherwise, fix the build pipeline.

**Debugging Resources**
- **Binary diff report**: Check the `diff.txt` file in the workflow artifacts for detailed differences between binaries
- **Build logs**: Review the complete build output in the workflow run
- **Local reproduction**: Use the build script locally to compare results
